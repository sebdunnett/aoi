>Site-based industrial operations such as mining, oil and gas extraction, and renewable energy development are associated with many direct and indirect impacts on biodiversity. Consideration of the full range of these impacts when selecting the Area of Influence (AoI) of a project is critical for effective biodiversity risk screening. Indirect impacts, however, are elusive despite often being more extensive than direct ones, both temporally and spatially. There is also limited clarity on the distinction between direct and indirect impacts, leading to the latter either being missed from screening analyses, or misclassified as direct impacts. Here we propose a definition of indirect impacts and a framework for incorporating them in risk and impact analyses. We define indirect impacts as those that are triggered by wider socio-economic and demographic changes induced by the project and not directly by project operations. Indirect impacts manifest through three pathways: increased access to intact ecosystems, increased in-migration and settlement, and increased viability of other economic activity. Literature on the exact spatial extent to which indirect impacts manifest is sparse. A range of factors, however, can act as predictors of the likelihood and intensity of indirect impacts and form the basis of a decision-making framework to select an AoI that captures them effectively.

This repository contains supporting code for a manuscript in review at *Methods in Ecology and Evolution*. A link to this paper will be added when/if accepted and published.

The processing script, *aoi_decision_layer.R* takes six data inputs to produce a raster screening layer that supports the assessment of project indirect impacts. To reproduce the analysis, researchers must first acquire the six input datasets from source:
